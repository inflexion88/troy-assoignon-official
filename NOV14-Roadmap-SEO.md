# NOV14 SEO / AI Search Roadmap

## 1. What the data is telling us
- Impressions without clicks for queries like “fractional CMO guiding AI intern teams for SMEs” (73 impressions, 0 clicks).
- Average position ~15 → likely FAQ/People Also Ask placements.
- Titles/meta feel generic; they don’t promise assets/outcomes.
- Topical depth is thin for AI + intern queries (single post).

## 2. Root causes
1. Title mismatch: snippets don’t mirror the wording people type.
2. Zero-click exposure: we answer everything in SERP with no hook.
3. Weak meta hooks: no mention of templates, dashboards, or ROI deliverables.
4. Shallow clusters: Google doesn’t see authority on AI + interns.
5. AI search readiness: no structured answer cards or HowTo schema.

## 3. Roadmap
### A. SERP CTR fixes (week 1)
- Rewrite titles/meta for high-impression URLs with keyword mirroring + asset hook.
### B. Zero-click defense (week 2)
- Add TL;DR cards + CTA links; embed FAQ schema.
### C. Topical authority expansion (weeks 2–4)
- Publish AI + intern cluster (hub + 3 supporting posts) and interlink; add positioning expert support content.
### D. AI search optimization (ongoing)
- Insert structured answer blocks, HowTo schema, proprietary stats.

## 4. Work queue
1. Rewrite titles/meta for the 10 keywords provided (start with fractional CMO + AI cluster).
2. Insert TL;DR cards + CTA hooks.
3. Publish the AI + intern cluster and interlink.
4. Add HowTo/FAQ schema where applicable.
5. Re-measure CTR after 30 days; iterate as needed.

### Measurement checklist
- Add Search Console annotations (“AI Intern Cluster”, “Positioning Diagnostic TLDR”) at deploy.
- Monitor CTR for `/blog/fractional-cmo-ai-marketing-teams-smes`, `/blog/what-is-positioning-expert-2025-guide.html`, `/blog/positioning-audit-checklist.html` after 30 days.
- Run monthly AI Overview checks for the target keywords and log citations.
