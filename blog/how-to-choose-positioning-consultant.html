                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Do you specialize in positioning, or do you also do branding?</strong> (Specialists deliver better strategic outcomes)</li>
                        <li><strong>What's your positioning methodology?</strong> (Named frameworks signal systematic approach)</li>
                        <li><strong>Can you show me 3 case studies with documented results?</strong> (Proof over promises)</li>
                        <li><strong>What industries or company stages do you specialize in?</strong> (Generalists lack depth)</li>
                        <li><strong>How do you handle competitive research?</strong> (Strategic vs. superficial analysis)</li>
                        <li><strong>What deliverables do I get?</strong> (Positioning statement isn't enough)</li>
                        <li><strong>How long does positioning work typically take?</strong> (60-90 days for depth)</li>
                        <li><strong>Do you do implementation, or just strategy?</strong> (Gap between strategy and execution)</li>
                        <li><strong>How do you measure positioning success?</strong> (Pricing power, margins, sales efficiency)</li>
                        <li><strong>What happens if our position needs to evolve?</strong> (Ongoing vs. one-time engagement)</li>
                        <li><strong>Who owns the positioning—me or my marketing team?</strong> (CEO-level vs. marketing function)</li>
                        <li><strong>What's your pricing model and typical investment?</strong> (Value-based vs. hourly billing)</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>Hiring the wrong positioning consultant costs you more than money—it costs you <strong>strategic clarity, market differentiation, and 6-12 months of lost positioning advantage</strong> while competitors entrench their positions.</p>

                <p>The problem? Most buyers can't distinguish between:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Positioning experts</strong> (strategic specialists focused on competitive territory and value architecture)</li>
                    <li><strong>Brand strategists</strong> (tactical generalists focused on messaging and visual identity)</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing agencies</strong> (execution shops that call creative work "positioning")</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This guide gives you 12 evaluation questions to separate true positioning expertise from generic marketing consulting—and avoid the $100K+ hiring mistakes that leave you with beautiful branding but undifferentiated strategy.</p>

                <h2>Question #1: Do You Specialize in Positioning, or Do You Also Do Branding?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning is fundamentally different from branding (read: <a href="/blog/positioning-vs-branding-differences.html">Positioning vs. Branding</a>). Firms that do both often:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Treat positioning as a preliminary step before "real work" (branding/creative)</li>
                    <li>Rush positioning strategy to get to higher-margin branding deliverables</li>
                    <li>Confuse messaging frameworks with strategic positioning</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We do full-service brand strategy—positioning, messaging, visual identity, and website design."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They're a branding agency that treats positioning as a checkbox.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "I only do positioning. If you need branding after we define your strategic position, I'll refer you to excellent creative partners who can execute against the positioning foundation we build."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They're specialized strategists who understand positioning is distinct work.</em></p>

                <h3>Follow-Up Question</h3>
                <p>"What percentage of your engagements are positioning-only vs. positioning + branding?"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If 80%+ include branding</strong> → They're a branding firm with positioning as an upsell</li>
                    <li><strong>If 80%+ are positioning-only</strong> → They're positioning specialists</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Question #2: What's Your Positioning Methodology?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning isn't creative intuition—it's systematic strategy. Consultants with proprietary methodologies have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repeatable processes (not ad-hoc approaches)</li>
                    <li>Proven frameworks tested across clients</li>
                    <li>Clear phases with defined outputs</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Consultants without named methodologies often improvise based on past experience, leading to inconsistent results.</p>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We take a customized approach based on your unique needs."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They don't have a systematic methodology—they're winging it.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "I use the Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework: Define (competitive landscape + value architecture), Design (narrative structure + proof points), Defend (moat identification + pricing architecture). Here's how each phase works..."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They have a structured, repeatable approach with documented outputs.</em></p>

                <h3>Follow-Up Question</h3>
                <p>"Can you walk me through your methodology step-by-step?"</p>
                <p>Strong consultants can articulate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phase names and objectives</li>
                    <li>Research inputs for each phase</li>
                    <li>Deliverable outputs at each stage</li>
                    <li>How phases build on each other</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Question #3: Can You Show Me 3 Case Studies with Documented Results?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning success should be measurable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pricing power:</strong> Premium pricing capability vs. competitors</li>
                    <li><strong>Margin expansion:</strong> Higher profitability from value-based positioning</li>
                    <li><strong>Sales efficiency:</strong> Shorter sales cycles, higher close rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Category leadership:</strong> Market recognition as a specialist</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Consultants who can't provide documented results either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Haven't measured outcomes (bad)</li>
                    <li>Didn't deliver measurable results (worse)</li>
                    <li>Don't have real positioning experience (worst)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We've worked with many clients but can't share specifics due to NDAs."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They either have no results or no permission to share them—both problematic.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "Here are three case studies: (1) B2B SaaS client achieved 28% pricing premium post-positioning, (2) Professional services firm expanded margins from 18% to 34% in 12 months, (3) Growth-stage company raised $4.5M using investor-ready positioning framework. I can walk you through the methodology for each."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They measure outcomes, track results, and have client permission to share.</em></p>

                <h3>What to Look For in Case Studies</h3>
                <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 30px 0;">

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <h2>Question #4: What Industries or Company Stages Do You Specialize In?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning challenges vary dramatically by industry and stage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seed-stage startups</strong> need category creation and investor positioning</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth-stage companies</strong> need competitive differentiation and scaling narratives</li>
                    <li><strong>Mature enterprises</strong> need repositioning and category redefinition</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Generalist consultants lack the depth to understand stage-specific positioning dynamics. Specialists bring pattern recognition from working with similar companies.</p>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We work with companies of all sizes across all industries."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They're generalists without specialized expertise.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "I specialize in growth-stage B2B services companies (Series A through growth equity) in capital-intensive or knowledge-intensive industries. I also work with executives launching premium-priced advisory practices. Here's why I focus there..."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They've chosen a niche where they have deep expertise and repeatable results.</em></p>

                <h3>Follow-Up Question</h3>
                <p>"Can you share 2-3 clients in my industry or at my stage?"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If yes</strong> → They understand your positioning context</li>
                    <li><strong>If no</strong> → You'll be paying them to learn your market (expensive education)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Question #5: How Do You Handle Competitive Research?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning is inherently competitive—it's about owning territory that competitors <em>don't</em> own. Superficial competitive analysis leads to weak positioning.</p>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We'll review your competitors' websites and positioning statements."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Surface-level research that misses strategic positioning.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "I do three-layer competitive analysis: (1) Direct competitor positioning and value claims, (2) Adjacent category alternatives that buyers consider, (3) Substitute behaviors—what customers do if they don't hire anyone. Then I map the competitive landscape to identify unclaimed territory that's strategically defensible."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Deep strategic research that finds positioning whitespace.</em></p>

                <h3>What Strong Competitive Research Includes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct competitors:</strong> Who claims similar positioning?</li>
                    <li><strong>Indirect alternatives:</strong> Different solutions to the same problem</li>
                    <li><strong>Substitute behaviors:</strong> What buyers do instead of hiring you</li>
                    <li><strong>Positioning map:</strong> Visual territory mapping on 2+ dimensions</li>
                    <li><strong>Whitespace identification:</strong> Valuable positions that are unclaimed</li>
                    <li><strong>Defensibility analysis:</strong> Can you credibly own that territory?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Question #6: What Deliverables Do I Get?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>A positioning statement alone isn't enough. You need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strategic documentation</strong> (positioning architecture, competitive maps)</li>
                    <li><strong>Messaging frameworks</strong> (how to communicate your position)</li>
                    <li><strong>Proof point libraries</strong> (evidence to support claims)</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation guidance</strong> (how to activate positioning)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "You'll get a positioning statement and messaging framework."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Incomplete deliverables that leave implementation gaps.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "Deliverables include: (1) Positioning architecture with competitive maps and value hierarchy, (2) Narrative framework with message tiers (10-second to 10-minute versions), (3) Proof point library with case studies and metrics, (4) Implementation roadmap for website, sales, and marketing activation, (5) Sales enablement guide for articulating differentiation."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Comprehensive strategic and tactical outputs.</em></p>

                <h2>Question #7: How Long Does Positioning Work Typically Take?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Strategic positioning requires depth—competitive research, customer interviews, value architecture design, proof point development. Rushed positioning produces superficial results.</p>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We can turn this around in 2-3 weeks."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Surface-level strategy, not deep positioning work.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "Typical engagements are 60-90 days: 3-4 weeks for research and competitive analysis, 3-4 weeks for positioning architecture and narrative development, 2-3 weeks for proof point integration and implementation roadmap, plus review cycles."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Thoughtful timeline that allows for strategic depth.</em></p>

                <h3>Realistic Positioning Timeline</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weeks 1-3:</strong> Discovery, competitive research, customer interviews, landscape mapping</li>
                    <li><strong>Weeks 4-6:</strong> Positioning architecture development, value hierarchy design, differentiation strategy</li>
                    <li><strong>Weeks 7-9:</strong> Narrative framework, messaging hierarchy, proof point library</li>
                    <li><strong>Weeks 10-12:</strong> Implementation roadmap, sales enablement, review/refinement</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Accelerated timelines (4-6 weeks):</strong> Possible for focused diagnostics or repositioning when competitive research exists. But comprehensive positioning strategy needs 8-12 weeks.</p>

                <h2>Question #8: Do You Do Implementation, or Just Strategy?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>The gap between "here's your positioning strategy" and "it's activated across all touchpoints" is where most positioning work fails. You need either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implementation support</strong> from your positioning consultant, OR</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear handoff</strong> to your internal team or agency partners</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We deliver the strategy deck, and your team handles implementation."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They leave you with a PDF and no execution support.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "I offer three implementation options: (1) Full implementation support where I work with your team to update website, sales materials, and marketing, (2) Hybrid where I provide detailed roadmaps and review your implementation, (3) Strategy-only with clear handoff documentation. Most clients choose hybrid."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Flexible support that bridges strategy to execution.</em></p>

                <h3>Follow-Up Question</h3>
                <p>"What does implementation typically include?"</p>
                <p>Strong consultants outline:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Website messaging updates (homepage, service pages, about)</li>
                    <li>Sales enablement (pitch decks, one-pagers, discovery frameworks)</li>
                    <li>Marketing activation (content strategy, email templates, campaign messaging)</li>
                    <li>Internal alignment (team training, positioning workshops)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Question #9: How Do You Measure Positioning Success?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning should deliver measurable business outcomes, not just "strategic clarity." If consultants can't articulate success metrics, they can't demonstrate ROI.</p>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "Success is improved market perception and clearer differentiation."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Vague, unmeasurable outcomes.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "I measure positioning success across three dimensions: (1) Pricing power—ability to command 15-30% premiums vs. generalist competitors, (2) Margin expansion—improved profitability from value-based pricing, (3) Sales efficiency—shorter sales cycles, higher close rates, less discounting. I track these metrics at 90 days and 12 months post-engagement."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Concrete, measurable business outcomes.</em></p>

                <h2>Question #10: What Happens If Our Position Needs to Evolve?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Markets shift. Competitors enter. Customer needs evolve. Your positioning may need refinement 12-24 months after initial work. Understanding ongoing support options prevents future gaps.</p>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "Positioning is a one-time engagement. Once we're done, you're set."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Transactional relationship with no ongoing partnership.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "Positioning typically holds for 2-3 years, but I recommend annual reviews to assess competitive shifts. I offer ongoing advisory retainers for clients who want strategic positioning support as they scale. Some clients also engage me for new positioning work as they enter new markets or launch new offerings."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Long-term partnership mindset with evolution support.</em></p>

                <h3>Follow-Up Question</h3>
                <p>"Do you offer fractional positioning advisory?"</p>
                <p>Strong consultants often provide <a href="/services/fractional-cmo-cpo.html">fractional CMO/CPO services</a> for ongoing positioning oversight without full-time hire commitment.</p>

                <h2>Question #11: Who Owns the Positioning—Me or My Marketing Team?</h2>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning is a <strong>CEO-level strategic decision</strong>, not a marketing function. Consultants who treat it as marketing work will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop positioning that lacks executive buy-in</li>
                    <li>Miss strategic implications for product, pricing, and sales</li>
                    <li>Create positioning that's disconnected from business strategy</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "We'll work with your marketing director to develop positioning."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They treat positioning as a marketing deliverable, not CEO-level strategy.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "Positioning is executive-level strategy—I work directly with the CEO or business unit leader. Marketing executes against the positioning, but the strategic decisions (who we serve, what territory we own, how we differentiate) are leadership decisions. I'll involve your CMO in implementation, but the CEO must own the positioning itself."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: They understand positioning is strategic, not tactical.</em></p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Positioning is strategic work that delivers 10-20x ROI when done right. Pricing models signal how consultants value their work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hourly billing</strong> = selling time (tactical mindset)</li>
                    <li><strong>Project-based</strong> = selling deliverables (transactional mindset)</li>
                    <li><strong>Value-based</strong> = selling outcomes (strategic mindset)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Listen For</h3>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> "I bill hourly at $X/hour, and positioning typically takes 40-60 hours."</p>
                <p><em>Translation: Time-based pricing that doesn't align with value delivered.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Green flag answer:</strong> "I use project-based pricing aligned with value delivered. Positioning engagements range from $25K for diagnostics to $150K for comprehensive repositioning with implementation. The investment depends on scope, company stage, and complexity. Here's how I think about pricing for your situation..."</p>

                    <li><strong>$100K positioning + implementation</strong> → 25% pricing premium on $5M revenue = $1.25M additional revenue = 12.5x ROI</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If the consultant can't articulate ROI potential, they're selling deliverables instead of outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Bonus Evaluation Criteria</h2>

                <h3>Do They Have a Positioning Framework They've Published?</h3>
                <p>Strong positioning consultants practice what they preach:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They have clear positioning for their own practice (not generic "brand strategist")</li>
                    <li>They've published frameworks, methodologies, or thought leadership</li>
                    <li>They're recognized as specialists in positioning (not generalists)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href="/blog/strategic-positioning-framework-deep-dive.html">Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework</a> is publicly documented, taught in workshops, and applied systematically across engagements.</p>

                <h3>Do They Ask Strategic Questions or Just Scoping Questions?</h3>
                <p>During your initial conversation, strong positioning consultants ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What's driving the need for positioning work right now?"</li>
                    <li>"How do your customers currently describe what you do?"</li>
                    <li>"What happens when you lose a deal—what do buyers say?"</li>
                    <li>"If you could own one category or position in the market, what would it be?"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Weak consultants focus on logistics: timeline, budget, stakeholders. Strong consultants diagnose your positioning challenges before proposing solutions.</p>

                <h3>Do They Have Client References You Can Contact?</h3>
                <p>Ask for 2-3 references from clients in similar industries or stages. Strong consultants readily provide contacts. Ask references:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What was the measurable business impact of the positioning work?"</li>
                    <li>"How did they handle challenges or pivots during the engagement?"</li>
                    <li>"Would you hire them again for future positioning needs?"</li>
                    <li>"What surprised you (positively or negatively) about working with them?"</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags: When to Walk Away</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>They promise quick fixes</strong> ("We'll have your positioning done in 2 weeks")</li>
                    <li><strong>They lead with creative/branding</strong> instead of strategy</li>
                    <li><strong>They can't explain their methodology</strong> in clear, specific terms</li>
                    <li><strong>They have no documented case studies</strong> with measurable results</li>
                    <li><strong>They position themselves as generalists</strong> ("We do everything from positioning to web design")</li>
                    <li><strong>They treat positioning as a marketing function</strong> instead of CEO-level strategy</li>
                    <li><strong>They can't articulate success metrics</strong> or ROI expectations</li>
                    <li><strong>Their own positioning is unclear</strong> (if they can't position themselves, how will they position you?)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Green Flags: Indicators of Strong Positioning Expertise</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Specialized focus</strong> (they serve a specific type of client, not "everyone")</li>
                    <li><strong>Named methodology</strong> with documented frameworks</li>
                    <li><strong>Case studies with metrics</strong> ($X results, Y% improvements)</li>
                    <li><strong>Published thought leadership</strong> (frameworks, articles, workshops)</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic questions</strong> that diagnose your positioning challenges</li>
                    <li><strong>CEO-level engagement</strong> (they insist on executive ownership)</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear success metrics</strong> (pricing power, margins, sales efficiency)</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation support</strong> or clear handoff process</li>
                    <li><strong>Value-based pricing</strong> aligned with outcomes delivered</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Use These Questions</h2>

                <h3>Step 1: Initial Screening (Questions 1-4)</h3>
                <p>Use the first four questions to screen for positioning specialization:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Positioning specialist or generalist?</li>
                    <li>Named methodology?</li>
                    <li>Case studies with results?</li>
                    <li>Industry/stage specialization?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>If they don't pass these, end the conversation—they're not positioning experts.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Methodology Evaluation (Questions 5-8)</h3>
                <p>For candidates who pass screening, assess their approach:</p>
                <ol start="5">
                    <li>Competitive research depth</li>
                    <li>Deliverable comprehensiveness</li>
                    <li>Realistic timeline</li>
                    <li>Implementation support</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step 3: Partnership Fit (Questions 9-12)</h3>
                <p>For finalists, evaluate long-term fit:</p>
                <ol start="9">
                    <li>Success measurement approach</li>
                    <li>Ongoing evolution support</li>
                    <li>Strategic vs. tactical ownership</li>
                    <li>Pricing model and investment</li>
                </ol>
