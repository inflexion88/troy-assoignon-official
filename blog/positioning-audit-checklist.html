                    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Quick Assessment Overview</h2>
                    <p><strong>This 23-point audit measures positioning strength across four dimensions:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Clarity (6 questions):</strong> Do you have clear, documented positioning?</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Differentiation (6 questions):</strong> Are you meaningfully different from competitors?</li>
                        <li><strong>Proof & Evidence (5 questions):</strong> Can you substantiate your positioning claims?</li>
                        <li><strong>Market Impact (6 questions):</strong> Is your positioning delivering business results?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Scoring:</strong> Answer each question with 0 (No), 1 (Somewhat), 2 (Mostly), or 3 (Definitely Yes). Total score out of 69 points.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>55-69:</strong> Strong positioning (minor refinements)</li>
                        <li><strong>35-54:</strong> Moderate positioning (strategic updates needed)</li>
                        <li><strong>0-34:</strong> Weak positioning (comprehensive repositioning required)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Most companies operate with weak or undifferentiated positioning—and don't realize it until they're trapped in price-based competition with eroding margins.</p>

                <p>This 23-point audit helps you diagnose your positioning strength <em>before</em> it becomes a revenue problem. Use it to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify strategic gaps in your positioning</li>
                    <li>Benchmark against positioning best practices</li>
                    <li>Prioritize repositioning initiatives by impact</li>
                    <li>Determine if you need <a href="/services/positioning-diagnostics.html">professional positioning diagnostics</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Time required:</strong> 20-30 minutes for honest self-assessment</p>

                <h2>How to Use This Audit</h2>

                <h3>Scoring System</h3>
                <p>For each question, assign a score:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0 = No / Not at all</strong> – This doesn't describe us</li>
                    <li><strong>1 = Somewhat</strong> – We partially meet this criterion</li>
                    <li><strong>2 = Mostly</strong> – We largely meet this, with minor gaps</li>
                    <li><strong>3 = Definitely Yes</strong> – We fully meet this criterion</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Be brutally honest.</strong> Grade yourself as a tough buyer would, not how you <em>want</em> to be perceived.</p>

                <h3>What to Do With Your Score</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Track scores by section</strong> to identify specific weakness areas (clarity, differentiation, proof, or impact)</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritize low-scoring items</strong> with highest revenue impact first</li>
                    <li><strong>Reassess quarterly</strong> to track positioning improvement over time</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Section 1: Strategic Clarity (18 points possible)</h2>
                <p>Strong positioning starts with clarity: you must know exactly who you serve, what you stand for, and how you're different. Without strategic clarity, everything downstream—messaging, sales, marketing—becomes muddled.</p>

                <h3>Question 1: Can you clearly define your target audience?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Do you have a specific, narrow target audience beyond "all businesses" or "mid-market companies"?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> "We serve Series A-C growth-stage B2B SaaS companies in financial services facing regulatory complexity" (highly specific)</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> "We serve B2B SaaS companies in growth stage" (somewhat specific)</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> "We serve B2B companies" (broad but not meaningless)</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> "We serve all businesses" (no targeting)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Narrow targeting enables category ownership. Broad targeting prevents differentiation.</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 2: Can you articulate your value proposition in one sentence?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Can you clearly state what value you deliver and to whom, in a single sentence that's understandable to buyers?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> One clear sentence that specifies who you serve, what problem you solve, and how you're uniquely positioned to solve it (e.g., "We help growth-stage B2B services companies achieve premium pricing through investor-ready strategic positioning")</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> One sentence that captures what you do, but lacks specificity on who or how</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> A sentence exists, but it's jargon-heavy or unclear</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No clear value proposition, or it takes multiple sentences to explain</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Test:</strong> Can a smart 12-year-old understand what you do from your one-sentence value prop?</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 3: Do you own a specific category or position in the market?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> When buyers think of your category, do they think of you? Or are you one of many undifferentiated options?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> You own a defined category where you're the clear leader (e.g., "positioning expert for growth-stage B2B," "M&A integration specialist for PE-backed industrials")</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> You have a category you compete in, and you're recognized as a top player but not the default choice</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> You're in a category but not differentiated within it</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> You compete in generic categories ("consulting," "agency," "services") with no differentiation</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Test:</strong> If a buyer Googles your category + a descriptor, do you appear on page 1?</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 4: Do you have a documented positioning statement?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Is your positioning formally documented (not just "in people's heads"), and does it include target audience, competitive alternative, unique differentiation, and value delivered?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Formal positioning statement documented and shared across leadership, sales, and marketing with all four components: (1) Target audience, (2) Competitive frame of reference, (3) Unique differentiation, (4) Value delivered</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Positioning is documented but missing one component or not widely shared</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Informal positioning exists (e.g., founder can articulate it) but not documented</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No formal positioning statement</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Undocumented positioning creates inconsistency across teams and messaging drift over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 5: Does your entire team understand and align on your positioning?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> If you asked 5 employees "What makes us different from competitors?" would they give consistent answers?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> 100% of sales/marketing/leadership can articulate positioning consistently using the same language and differentiation points</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Most team members (70%+) can articulate positioning, though wording varies</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Some team members (30-70%) understand positioning, but answers are inconsistent</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> Team members give wildly different answers about what makes you different</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Test:</strong> Actually ask 5 team members this question and compare answers.</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 6: Can your sales team explain why a customer should choose you (without mentioning price)?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Does your sales team lead with strategic differentiation, or do they default to features, capabilities, or discounting?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Sales consistently leads with strategic positioning and value differentiation; pricing is anchored to value, not discounted to win deals</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Sales can articulate differentiation when asked, but often falls back to features or capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Sales mentions differentiation but relies heavily on price/terms to close</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> Sales competes primarily on price or relationship; differentiation is unclear</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If your sales team can't sell on differentiation, your positioning is either weak or poorly communicated.</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Section 1 Total (Strategic Clarity): _____ / 18</strong></p>

                <hr style="margin: 40px 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #ddd;">

                <h2>Section 2: Competitive Differentiation (18 points possible)</h2>
                <p>Positioning is fundamentally competitive—it's about owning territory that competitors don't own. This section assesses whether you have defensible, meaningful differentiation.</p>

                <h3>Question 7: Do you deliver value that competitors can't easily replicate?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Is your differentiation based on proprietary capabilities, specialized expertise, or unique assets? Or could competitors copy you in 6 months?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Your differentiation is based on proprietary methodologies, deep specialization, unique data/assets, or network effects that take years to build</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> You have differentiation that's somewhat difficult to copy but not impossible</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Your differentiation exists but is easily replicable (e.g., "we have great customer service")</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No meaningful differentiation; you do what everyone else does</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Test:</strong> Could a well-funded competitor replicate your differentiation in under 12 months? If yes, it's not defensible.</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 8: When buyers compare you to competitors, is the difference clear?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Do buyers see you as meaningfully different, or do they lump you in with "similar" alternatives?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Buyers consistently say "you're the only one who does X" or "you're in a different category than the others"</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Buyers acknowledge differences, but still compare you to 2-3 alternatives</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Buyers see minor differences but consider you "basically similar" to competitors</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> Buyers say "you all seem the same" or "I'm evaluating 5 similar firms"</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Source of truth:</strong> Buyer feedback during discovery calls or post-win interviews.</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 9: Have you created meaningful switching costs or lock-in?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Once a customer works with you, is it difficult for them to switch to a competitor? Or are you easily replaceable?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> High switching costs due to proprietary processes, integration depth, or network effects (customers would lose significant value by switching)</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Moderate switching costs; it would be inconvenient but not costly to switch</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Low switching costs; customers could replace you relatively easily</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No switching costs; you're a commodity service easily replaced</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Switching costs = defensible positioning. No switching costs = you compete on price every renewal.</p>

                <h3>Question 10: Do you track win/loss analysis to understand competitive dynamics?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Do you systematically analyze why you win and lose deals, and use that data to refine positioning?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Formal win/loss analysis for all significant deals, with documented patterns on positioning strength/weaknesses</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Informal win/loss tracking; you know generally why you win/lose but not systematically documented</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Occasional win/loss analysis, but not consistent</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No win/loss analysis; you don't know why buyers choose competitors</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key questions to ask:</strong> "Why did you choose us?" (wins) and "What made you choose the alternative?" (losses)</p>

                <h3>Question 11: Do you own "whitespace" territory that competitors haven't claimed?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Have you identified and claimed a valuable market position that competitors aren't targeting?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> You've identified and claimed whitespace that's strategically valuable but unclaimed by competitors (e.g., "investor-ready positioning for growth-stage B2B services")</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> You compete in a position that has some differentiation but others are moving into it</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Your position has minor whitespace elements but largely overlaps with competitors</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> You compete in saturated territory with no whitespace</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Test:</strong> Search "[your positioning] expert" and see if competitors appear. If page 1 is all competitors, you're in saturated territory.</p>

                <p><strong>Your score (0-3): _____</strong></p>

                <h3>Question 12: Do you have a "moat"—a defensible competitive advantage?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> What prevents competitors from displacing you? Brand equity? Proprietary assets? Network effects? Specialized expertise?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>

                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> One clear moat that provides meaningful protection</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Weak moats that provide minimal protection (e.g., "we've been around longer")</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No moats; competitors can replicate everything you do</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Common moats:</strong> Proprietary frameworks, specialized expertise (years to build), category ownership, brand equity, customer lock-in, network effects, unique data/assets.</p>

                <h2>Section 3: Proof & Evidence (15 points possible)</h2>
                <p>Positioning claims without proof = buyer skepticism. This section assesses whether you can substantiate your strategic position with documented evidence.</p>

                <h3>Question 13: Do you have case studies with documented, quantified results?</h3>

                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No case studies or documented results</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> "We're great" is a claim. "$4.5M raised for client X in 90 days" is proof.</p>

                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> General sense of ROI but no specific documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> Cannot quantify ROI; value is "strategic" or "intangible"</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Test:</strong> Can you fill in this sentence with real numbers? "Our clients typically achieve $____ in [revenue/margin/cost savings] within [timeframe]."</p>

                <h3>Question 15: Do you have client testimonials that speak to your positioning?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Do testimonials reinforce your strategic position, or are they generic praise?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Testimonials specifically reference your positioning (e.g., "Troy's positioning expertise helped us command 40% premium pricing" vs. "Great to work with!")</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Testimonials mention outcomes but don't tie directly to positioning</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Generic testimonials ("professional," "responsive," "knowledgeable")</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No testimonials or only anonymous quotes</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Positioning-specific testimonial example:</strong> "Troy's investor-ready positioning framework was instrumental in our $4.5M raise. His strategic clarity turned abstract expertise into fundable narrative."</p>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> "I'm an expert" is a claim. "Featured in X publication, worked with Y Fortune 500 companies" is validation.</p>

                <h3>Question 18: Can you command premium pricing vs. generalist competitors?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Do you charge 15-30%+ more than less-differentiated alternatives?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> You consistently price 25%+ above generalist competitors and win deals at that premium</li>

                <h3>Question 19: Are your profit margins expanding (or maintaining premium levels)?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Do you maintain 30%+ margins, or are you closer to 10-15% commodity margins?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Gross margins of 35%+ and growing (or maintaining premium levels)</li>

                <h3>Question 20: Is your sales cycle efficient (shorter than 6 months for complex B2B)?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Does clear positioning accelerate buyer decisions, or do deals drag on due to competitive evaluation?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Sales cycles are 30-50% shorter than industry average; buyers make fast decisions because differentiation is clear</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Sales cycles are average for your industry</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Sales cycles are longer than average due to competitive evaluation</li>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>Positioning impact:</strong> When you're the only option (strong positioning), cycles shorten. When you're one of five (weak positioning), cycles extend.</p>

                <h3>Question 21: Do you attract high-quality inbound inquiries (not just volume)?</h3>
                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Are inbound leads pre-qualified by your positioning, or do you get generic "how much does it cost?" inquiries?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Inbound leads are pre-qualified, understand your positioning, and have higher close rates than outbound</li>

                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> No meaningful inbound; you rely entirely on outbound prospecting</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> You're the default choice in your category; buyers start with you and only consider alternatives if you decline</li>

                <p><strong>What to assess:</strong> Can you attribute revenue growth to stronger positioning (higher pricing, better close rates, category leadership)?</p>

                <p><strong>Scoring guide:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 points:</strong> Revenue growth is directly attributable to positioning improvements (documented through win rate, pricing, or market share gains)</li>
                    <li><strong>2 points:</strong> Revenue is growing, and positioning contributes but isn't the primary driver</li>
                    <li><strong>1 point:</strong> Revenue growth is flat or growing only due to market expansion, not positioning</li>
                    <li><strong>0 points:</strong> Revenue is declining or stagnant despite market growth (positioning problem)</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Identify 2-3 lowest-scoring questions and address those specific gaps</li>
                    <li>Strengthen proof points (case studies, ROI documentation, testimonials)</li>
                    <li>Expand thought leadership to reinforce category ownership</li>
                    <li>Consider <a href="/services/positioning-diagnostics.html">positioning diagnostics</a> to find optimization opportunities</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 30-60 days to address refinements</p>

                <h3>35-54 Points: Moderate Positioning (Strategic Updates Needed)</h3>
                <p><strong>What it means:</strong> You have positioning foundations but significant gaps in differentiation, proof, or market impact. You're vulnerable to competitive displacement or commoditization.</p>

                <p><strong>Recommended actions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conduct formal <a href="/services/positioning-diagnostics.html">positioning diagnostics</a> to identify highest-impact improvements</li>
                    <li>Narrow your target audience to enable category ownership</li>
                    <li>Develop documented case studies with quantified results</li>
                    <li>Update positioning statement and align team on differentiation</li>
                    <li>Consider strategic repositioning engagement (60-90 days)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Common weaknesses at this level:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Broad targeting ("we serve all companies")</li>
                    <li>Weak competitive differentiation ("we're like X but with better service")</li>
                    <li>Lack of documented proof points</li>
                    <li>Pricing pressure and margin compression</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 90-120 days for strategic repositioning</p>

                <h3>0-34 Points: Weak Positioning (Comprehensive Repositioning Required)</h3>
                <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Your positioning is fundamentally weak or nonexistent. You're likely competing on price, struggling with commoditization, and experiencing margin pressure. This is a critical business issue.</p>

                <p><strong>Recommended actions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Engage <a href="/services/strategic-brand-positioning.html">comprehensive positioning strategy</a> to define competitive territory and value architecture</li>
                    <li>Conduct competitive research to identify whitespace opportunities</li>
                    <li>Narrow target audience dramatically (3-5x narrower than current)</li>
                    <li>Document value delivered with case studies and ROI metrics</li>
                    <li>Implement positioning across website, sales, and marketing</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Warning signs you're likely experiencing:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You all seem the same" from buyers during evaluations</li>
                    <li>Win rate below 30% in competitive situations</li>
                    <li>Frequent price negotiation and discounting to close deals</li>
                    <li>Long sales cycles (6+ months) with heavy RFP processes</li>
                    <li>Margins below 20% and declining</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Cost of inaction:</strong> Weak positioning leads to 15-25% pricing discounts, 50-70% lower margins vs. specialists, and competitive displacement by differentiated alternatives.</p>

                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 90-120 days for comprehensive repositioning + 60 days for implementation</p>

                <h2>Prioritizing Positioning Improvements</h2>

                <h3>If Section 1 (Strategic Clarity) is lowest:</h3>
                <p><strong>Start here.</strong> Without strategic clarity, everything else fails. Actions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define narrow target audience (industry + stage + use case)</li>
                    <li>Document positioning statement with all four components</li>
                    <li>Align team through positioning workshops</li>
                    <li>Enable sales with differentiation talking points</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>If Section 2 (Competitive Differentiation) is lowest:</h3>
                <p>You have clarity but weak differentiation. Actions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Map competitive landscape to find whitespace</li>
                    <li>Identify your unique moats (what competitors can't replicate)</li>
                    <li>Develop proprietary methodology or framework</li>
                    <li>Create switching costs through integration or specialization</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>If Section 3 (Proof & Evidence) is lowest:</h3>
                <p>You have positioning but can't prove it. Actions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Document 3-5 case studies with specific metrics</li>
                    <li>Calculate and publish ROI data</li>
                    <li>Request positioning-specific testimonials from clients</li>
                    <li>Publish thought leadership (frameworks, articles, workshops)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>If Section 4 (Market Impact) is lowest:</h3>
                <p>Your positioning isn't translating to business results. Actions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Audit pricing—are you charging premium vs. competitors?</li>
                    <li>Analyze win/loss data to identify positioning gaps</li>
                    <li>Track sales cycle length and close rates by positioning strength</li>
                    <li>Measure inbound lead quality and category awareness</li>
                </ol>
