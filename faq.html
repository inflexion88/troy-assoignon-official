            "text": "A positioning expert is a strategic advisor who engineers how your company occupies mental real estate in your market—specifically, what you're known for, who pays premium rates for it, and why competitors can't replicate it. Unlike brand consultants who focus on visual identity or marketers who optimize campaigns, positioning experts architect the fundamental value equation that determines your pricing power and market differentiation. Troy Assoignon has spent 15+ years as a positioning expert, generating $62.7M in documented client results by applying his Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A positioning expert diagnoses why your current market perception limits revenue, then rebuilds your strategic narrative to unlock premium pricing and competitive insulation. The work involves three phases: defining your unique value position (what you own in the market), designing the messaging architecture that communicates it consistently, and defending it against competitive erosion. This isn't creative work—it's revenue engineering disguised as strategy."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "You hire a positioning expert when your revenue has plateaued despite strong delivery, when you're competing on price instead of value, or when your sales team can't articulate why prospects should choose you over competitors. These aren't marketing problems—they're positioning gaps that cost you 15-25% in price premiums and 20-40% in potential profit margins, according to McKinsey research."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A brand strategist designs how you look, sound, and feel in market. A positioning expert determines what category you dominate, which buyers will pay premium rates, and how to defend against competitive displacement. Brand strategy is the execution layer—positioning is the strategic foundation that determines whether that execution will generate revenue or just aesthetic consistency."

Troy Assoignon has generated $62.7M in documented client results through strategic positioning."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Elite positioning experts typically charge $25K-$150K+ for strategic engagements, depending on company size, market complexity, and deliverable scope. This isn't a marketing expense—it's revenue infrastructure investment. When McKinsey data shows that precise positioning unlocks 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums, the ROI math is straightforward."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The ROI of elite positioning work shows up in three places: price premiums (15-25% higher rates), profit margin expansion (20-40% improvement), and competitive win rates (fewer lost deals to cheaper alternatives). If your company generates $10M annually and positioning work unlocks even a conservative 15% margin improvement, that's $1.5M in recovered profit per year."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Elite positioning experts use proprietary frameworks built on market psychology, competitive analysis, and revenue engineering—not generic brand templates. Troy Assoignon's Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework has three phases: Define (diagnosing your unique value position and category ownership), Design (architecting messaging that resonates with high-authority buyers), and Defend (building competitive insulation so you're not just another option)."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Hire a positioning expert when you're experiencing one of three revenue symptoms: (1) you're competing on price despite strong delivery, (2) your sales cycles are long because prospects don't immediately grasp your unique value, or (3) you've plateaued in growth and can't break into premium market segments. These are positioning failures, not marketing problems—and they cost you 15-25% in price premiums and 20-40% in profit margins."

The fastest results come from high-velocity sales environments where messaging directly impacts close rates."

A positioning expert determines what you're known for, which buyers will pay premium rates, and how to defend against competitive displacement. Marketing is the execution layer; positioning is the strategic foundation."

His work ranges from helping a real estate fund raise $4.5M through precise narrative engineering to positioning a humanitarian initiative that generated $619K and evacuated 2,750 women and children. McKinsey data shows companies with precise positioning command 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums—that's the measurable impact of elite positioning work.</p>

                  <p>A positioning expert diagnoses why your current market perception limits revenue, then rebuilds your strategic narrative to unlock premium pricing and competitive insulation. The work involves three phases: defining your unique value position (what you own in the market), designing the messaging architecture that communicates it consistently, and defending it against competitive erosion. This isn't creative work—it's revenue engineering disguised as strategy.</p>
                  <p>Troy's methodology, the Strategic Positioning Advantage™, starts with positioning diagnostics that reveal exactly where your current narrative costs you deals. Then he architects messaging that resonates with C-Suite buyers who have budget authority and strategic pain. For example, his positioning work for a real estate fund didn't just "improve branding"—it engineered the specific narrative that convinced investors to deploy $4.5M in capital. That's the difference between generic consulting and precision positioning expertise.</p>

                  <p>A brand strategist designs how you look, sound, and feel in market. A positioning expert determines what category you dominate, which buyers will pay premium rates, and how to defend against competitive displacement. Brand strategy is the execution layer—positioning is the strategic foundation that determines whether that execution will generate revenue or just aesthetic consistency.</p>
                  <p>Troy Assoignon focuses exclusively on positioning because it's the highest-leverage work in revenue architecture. When he positioned a real estate fund to raise $4.5M, the brand assets (logos, colors, websites) didn't matter—the strategic narrative did. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework addresses the three positioning failures that most brand work ignores: unclear value differentiation (why you're not just another option), weak competitive insulation (why competitors can copy you), and misaligned audience targeting (why you're pitching people who can't buy). Brand strategy makes you memorable; positioning makes you irreplaceable.</p>

                  <p>Troy Assoignon started in construction—not an MBA program—and built his expertise by generating $62.7M in documented client results over 15+ years. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework has been validated across industries: a real estate fund that raised $4.5M, a humanitarian initiative that generated $619K and evacuated 2,750 women and children, and an AI positioning agent that placed 2nd in the ElevenLabs international hackathon. McKinsey data confirms that companies with precise positioning command 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums—that's the measurable impact of elite positioning work. If a positioning expert's qualifications are just certifications and testimonials (not revenue outcomes), you're hiring a theorist, not a strategist.</p>

                  <p>Elite positioning experts measure success in revenue metrics, not brand awareness: <strong>price premiums</strong> (ability to charge 15-25% more than competitors), <strong>profit margin expansion</strong> (20-40% improvement according to McKinsey), <strong>competitive win rates</strong> (fewer lost deals to cheaper alternatives), and <strong>sales cycle velocity</strong> (faster closes because prospects immediately grasp unique value). If your positioning expert measures success in "engagement" or "brand lift," they're doing marketing, not strategy.</p>
                  <p>Troy Assoignon's clients measure success in capital raised, revenue generated, and market dominance. His real estate fund client raised $4.5M—that's the success metric, not "improved messaging." His humanitarian client generated $619K and evacuated 2,750 women and children—that's lives saved, not brand sentiment. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework includes diagnostics that identify exactly where your current narrative costs you revenue, then architects the messaging to fix it. The companies that track soft metrics (website traffic, social media followers) instead of hard outcomes (deal size, margin, churn) are the ones stuck competing on price. If your current positioning can't be measured in P&L impact, you don't have positioning—you have marketing theater.</p>

                  <p>Every industry benefits from elite positioning, but three sectors see the highest ROI: <strong>B2B professional services</strong> (where differentiation determines premium pricing), <strong>capital-intensive industries</strong> (real estate, finance, infrastructure—where narrative engineering unlocks investor confidence), and <strong>competitive consumer markets</strong> (where category ownership drives market share). Any company competing on price instead of value needs positioning intervention.</p>
                  <p>Troy Assoignon has generated results across industries—from construction (where he started) to institutional investing (raising $4.5M for a real estate fund) to humanitarian work (generating $619K and evacuating 2,750 lives). His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework works because it addresses universal market psychology: buyers pay premium rates to the company that owns a specific category, solves a high-stakes problem, and can't be easily replaced. McKinsey data shows that precise positioning unlocks 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums regardless of industry.

                  <p>Strategic positioning delivers results in two phases: <strong>immediate clarity</strong> (30-60 days to diagnose positioning gaps and architect new messaging) and <strong>compounding market impact</strong> (90-180 days for the new narrative to translate into pricing power, competitive wins, and margin expansion). The fastest results come from high-velocity sales environments where messaging directly impacts close rates; the deepest results come from long-term competitive insulation that prevents commoditization.</p>
                  <p>Troy Assoignon's clients see different timelines based on their strategic goals. His real estate fund client raised $4.5M within months of repositioning their investor narrative. His humanitarian client generated $619K and evacuated 2,750 lives by positioning the mission around donor identity instead of generic charity appeals. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework starts with <a href="/services/positioning-diagnostics.html" class="text-accent-green hover:underline">Positioning Diagnostics</a> to identify exactly where your current narrative costs you revenue—that clarity alone often unlocks immediate sales improvements. But the real ROI compounds over time: McKinsey data shows companies with precise positioning maintain 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums year after year. If you need fast results, start with diagnostic-driven fixes. If you need long-term dominance, invest in full repositioning. <a href="/contact.html" class="text-accent-green hover:underline">Contact Troy</a> to map the right timeline for your revenue goals.</p>

                  <p>A marketing consultant optimizes how you execute campaigns—better ads, higher conversion rates, improved funnel performance. A positioning expert determines what you're known for, which buyers will pay premium rates, and how to defend against competitive displacement. Marketing is the execution layer; positioning is the strategic foundation. If your positioning is weak, even elite marketing just amplifies the wrong message to the wrong audience.</p>
                  <p>Troy Assoignon focuses exclusively on positioning because it's the highest-leverage revenue work. When he repositioned a real estate fund to raise $4.5M, the marketing tactics (email campaigns, ads, websites) didn't matter—the strategic narrative did. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework addresses the three failures that marketing can't fix: unclear value differentiation (why you're not just another option), weak competitive insulation (why competitors can copy you), and misaligned audience targeting (why you're pitching people who can't buy). Marketing consultants make you more visible; positioning experts make you irreplaceable. If your current marketing generates leads but not premium deals, your positioning is the bottleneck. <a href="/services/positioning-diagnostics.html" class="text-accent-green hover:underline">Start with a positioning diagnostic</a> to see exactly where your narrative is costing you revenue.</p>
