            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A positioning expert is a strategic advisor who engineers how your company occupies mental real estate in your market: specifically, what you're known for, who pays premium rates for it, and why competitors can't replicate it. Unlike brand consultants who focus on visual identity or marketers who optimize campaigns, positioning experts architect the fundamental value equation that determines your pricing power and market differentiation. Troy Assoignon has spent 15+ years as a positioning expert, generating $62.7M in documented client results by applying his Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A positioning expert diagnoses why your current market perception limits revenue, then rebuilds your strategic narrative to unlock premium pricing and competitive insulation. The work involves three phases: defining your unique value position (what you own in the market), designing the messaging architecture that communicates it consistently, and defending it against competitive erosion. This isn't creative work. It's revenue engineering disguised as strategy."

These aren't marketing problems. They're positioning gaps that cost you 15-25% in price premiums and 20-40% in potential profit margins, according to McKinsey research."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A brand strategist designs how you look, sound, and feel in market. A positioning expert determines what category you dominate, which buyers will pay premium rates, and how to defend against competitive displacement. Brand strategy is the execution layer. Positioning is the strategic foundation that determines whether that execution will generate revenue or just aesthetic consistency."

            "text": "Elite positioning experts deliver three measurable outcomes: premium pricing power (15-25% higher rates according to McKinsey), competitive insulation (reduced churn and commoditization), and faster sales cycles (because prospects immediately understand your unique value). These aren't soft brand metrics. They're revenue engineering results that show up in P&L statements and win rates. Troy Assoignon has generated $62.7M in documented client results through strategic positioning."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Elite positioning experts typically charge $25K-$150K+ for strategic engagements, depending on company size, market complexity, and deliverable scope. This isn't a marketing expense. It's revenue infrastructure investment. When McKinsey data shows that precise positioning unlocks 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums, the ROI math is straightforward: if you generate $5M annually, a 20% margin improvement is $1M in recovered profit. That makes a $50K positioning engagement a 20x return in year one."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The ROI of elite positioning work shows up in three places: price premiums (15-25% higher rates), profit margin expansion (20-40% improvement), and competitive win rates (fewer lost deals to cheaper alternatives). If your company generates $10M annually and positioning work unlocks even a conservative 15% margin improvement, that's $1.5M in recovered profit per year."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Elite positioning experts use proprietary frameworks built on market psychology, competitive analysis, and revenue engineering (not generic brand templates). The best methodologies address three strategic questions: What category do you dominate? Which buyers will pay premium rates for it? How do you defend against competitive displacement? Without answers to all three, you're just guessing at differentiation. Troy Assoignon's Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework has three phases: Define (diagnosing your unique value position and category ownership), Design (architecting messaging that resonates with high-authority buyers), and Defend (building competitive insulation so you're not just another option)."

These are positioning failures, not marketing problems, and they cost you 15-25% in price premiums and 20-40% in profit margins, according to McKinsey data."

Most consultants can't show specific ROI because their work is aesthetic, not strategic."

Academic credentials matter less than real-world ability to engineer market differentiation that translates to pricing power.

Any company competing on price instead of value needs positioning intervention."

The fastest results come from high-velocity sales environments where messaging directly impacts close rates; the deepest results come from long-term competitive insulation that prevents commoditization."

A positioning expert determines what you're known for, which buyers will pay premium rates, and how to defend against competitive displacement. Marketing is the execution layer; positioning is the strategic foundation. If your positioning is weak, even elite marketing just amplifies the wrong message to the wrong audience."

For most companies, positioning ROI exceeds 10-20x within the first year. Troy's clients have generated $62.7M in documented results from positioning engagements, including a $4.5M fund raise for a real estate expert with no prior fundraising experience."

Positioning diagnostics take 7-14 days. Market impact compounds over 90-180 days as the new positioning translates into revenue wins."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes. Your brand is the visual and verbal expression of your positioning, but branding doesn't create the strategic foundation. Many companies have beautiful brands that communicate weak positioning—premium aesthetics describing commodity value. If you're competing on price despite strong branding, if your sales team struggles to justify premium pricing, or if prospects confuse you with competitors, you have a positioning problem that branding alone can't fix. Positioning determines what you're known for; branding makes that memorable."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Positioning is the strategic decision about what mental territory you own in the market—your unique value position, competitive frame of reference, and defensible differentiation. Messaging is the tactical execution that communicates that position across different audiences and channels. Positioning answers: What do we own? Messaging answers: How do we say it? You can have great messaging with weak positioning (eloquent communication of commodity value), but you can't have effective messaging without clear positioning."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Absolutely. Investor-ready positioning is critical for fundraising because VCs and institutional investors evaluate: your competitive moat (defensible differentiation), market opportunity (category you can own), and narrative clarity (ability to articulate unique value). Companies with elite positioning raise capital faster, at higher valuations, with better terms. Troy's positioning work has enabled clients to raise $4.5M for a real estate fund, $619K for a humanitarian organization, and position for Series A-C funding rounds. If investors can't immediately grasp your unique position, positioning work precedes fundraising."

The Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework is industry-agnostic but particularly powerful in competitive markets where differentiation determines pricing power and margin capture."

            "@type": "Answer",

Unlike brand metrics (awareness, recall), positioning metrics tie directly to revenue and profitability. The ultimate test: Can you charge more than competitors for equivalent solutions because buyers perceive superior strategic value?"

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Troy works with both, but the engagement focus differs by stage. Pre-Series A startups benefit from positioning diagnostics and investor-ready positioning (category selection, competitive framing, fundraising narrative). Series A-C companies need full positioning engagements (systematic Define-Design-Defend implementation as they scale). Established companies ($10M+ revenue) typically require repositioning work (fixing commodity positioning, defending against new competitors, maintaining clarity during growth). The common thread: companies competing on value instead of price, targeting premium positioning and margin expansion."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Positioning diagnostics range from $5,000-$25,000 depending on company complexity. Full positioning engagements (Define-Design-Defend framework implementation) range from $25,000-$150,000 based on scope, company size, and market complexity. Fractional CMO/CPO services (ongoing positioning oversight) range from $10,000-$40,000 monthly. Pricing reflects the revenue impact: clients typically see 10-20x ROI through pricing power, margin expansion, and sales efficiency improvements. Investment in positioning pays for itself within 3-6 months through better deal economics and competitive positioning."

                  <p class="faq-preview">A positioning expert is a strategic advisor who engineers how your company occupies mental real estate in your market: specifically, what you're known for, who pays premium rates for it, and why competitors can't replicate it. Unlike brand consultants who focus on visual identity or marketers who optimize campaigns, positioning experts architect the fundamental value equation that determines your pricing power and market differentiation.</p>

                    <p class="mt-4">Troy Assoignon has spent 15+ years as a positioning expert, generating $62.7M in documented client results by applying his Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework. His work ranges from helping a real estate fund raise $4.5M through precise narrative engineering to positioning a humanitarian initiative that generated $619K and evacuated 2,750 women and children. McKinsey data shows companies with precise positioning command 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums. That's the measurable impact of elite positioning work.</p>

                  <p class="faq-preview">A positioning expert diagnoses why your current market perception limits revenue, then rebuilds your strategic narrative to unlock premium pricing and competitive insulation. The work involves three phases: defining your unique value position (what you own in the market), designing the messaging architecture that communicates it consistently, and defending it against competitive erosion. This isn't creative work. It's revenue engineering disguised as strategy.</p>
                  <div class="faq-extended-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="mt-4">Troy's methodology, the Strategic Positioning Advantage™, starts with positioning diagnostics that reveal exactly where your current narrative costs you deals. Then he architects messaging that resonates with C-Suite buyers who have budget authority and strategic pain. For example, his positioning work for a real estate fund didn't just "improve branding." It engineered the specific narrative that convinced investors to deploy $4.5M in capital. That's the difference between generic consulting and precision positioning expertise.</p>

                  <p class="faq-preview">A brand strategist designs how you look, sound, and feel in market. A positioning expert determines what category you dominate, which buyers will pay premium rates, and how to defend against competitive displacement. Brand strategy is the execution layer. Positioning is the strategic foundation that determines whether that execution will generate revenue or just aesthetic consistency.</p>

                    <p class="mt-4">Troy Assoignon focuses exclusively on positioning because it's the highest-leverage work in revenue architecture. When he positioned a real estate fund to raise $4.5M, the brand assets (logos, colors, websites) didn't matter. The strategic narrative did. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework addresses the three positioning failures that most brand work ignores: unclear value differentiation (why you're not just another option), weak competitive insulation (why competitors can copy you), and misaligned audience targeting (why you're pitching people who can't buy). Brand strategy makes you memorable; positioning makes you irreplaceable.</p>

This isn't a marketing expense. It's revenue infrastructure investment. When McKinsey data shows that precise positioning unlocks 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums, the ROI math is straightforward: if you generate $5M annually, a 20% margin improvement is $1M in recovered profit. That makes a $50K positioning engagement a 20x return in year one.</p>

This isn't theory. It's the same methodology that helped a real estate fund raise $4.5M, a humanitarian initiative generate $619K and evacuate 2,750 lives, and an AI positioning agent place 2nd in the ElevenLabs international hackathon. Troy started in construction, not academia, so his frameworks are built for revenue outcomes, not consulting theater.

His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework is precise enough to systematize and proven across industries, from construction (where he started) to institutional investing.

                  <p class="faq-preview">The best positioning experts have three qualifications: <strong>revenue-generating experience</strong> (not just consulting credentials), <strong>a proprietary methodology</strong> (framework-driven, not ad hoc advice), and <strong>documented results</strong> (specific outcomes like capital raised, margin expansion, or competitive wins).

                    <p class="mt-4">Troy Assoignon started in construction (not an MBA program) and built his expertise by generating $62.7M in documented client results over 15+ years. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework has been validated across industries: a real estate fund that raised $4.5M, a humanitarian initiative that generated $619K and evacuated 2,750 women and children, and an AI positioning agent that placed 2nd in the ElevenLabs international hackathon. McKinsey data confirms that companies with precise positioning command 20-40% higher profit margins and 15-25% price premiums. That's the measurable impact of elite positioning work. If a positioning expert's qualifications are just certifications and testimonials (not revenue outcomes), you're hiring a theorist, not a strategist.</p>

                  <p class="faq-preview">Elite positioning experts measure success in revenue metrics, not brand awareness: <strong>price premiums</strong> (ability to charge 15-25% more than competitors), <strong>profit margin expansion</strong> (20-40% improvement according to McKinsey), <strong>competitive win rates</strong> (fewer lost deals to cheaper alternatives), and <strong>sales cycle velocity</strong> (faster closes because prospects immediately grasp unique value).

That's the success metric, not "improved messaging." His humanitarian client generated $619K and evacuated 2,750 women and children. That's lives saved, not brand sentiment. His Strategic Positioning Advantage™ framework includes diagnostics that identify exactly where your current narrative costs you revenue, then architects the messaging to fix it. The companies that track soft metrics (website traffic, social media followers) instead of hard outcomes (deal size, margin, churn) are the ones stuck competing on price. If your current positioning can't be measured in P&L impact, you don't have positioning. You have marketing theater.</p>
